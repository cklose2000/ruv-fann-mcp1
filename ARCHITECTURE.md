# ruv-FANN MCP Architecture

## System Overview

The ruv-FANN MCP Server acts as an intelligent intermediary between Claude Code and its tool executions, providing predictive capabilities and learning from past behaviors.

```
Claude Code
    ↓
MCP Protocol
    ↓
ruv-FANN MCP Server (TypeScript)
    ↓
Backend Services (Rust):
  - Neural Network Core (Port 8090)
  - Swarm Coordinator (Port 8081)  
  - Model Server (Port 8082)
```

## Core Components

### 1. MCP Server Layer (TypeScript)

**Purpose**: Interface with Claude Code via Model Context Protocol

**Components**:
- **Tool Interceptor**: Captures tool requests before execution
- **Pattern Predictor**: Generates predictions using backend services
- **Pattern Learner**: Stores and learns from execution outcomes
- **Client Adapters**: Communicate with ruv-FANN backend

**Data Flow**:
```
Tool Request → Interceptor → Predictor → Backend Analysis → Prediction Response
                    ↓
              Pattern Storage
```

### 2. Ephemeral Agent System (Rust)

**Purpose**: Parallel pattern analysis with specialized agents

**Agent Types**:
- **PatternMatcher**: Finds similar historical commands
- **OutcomePredictor**: Predicts success/failure probability
- **AlternativeGen**: Suggests better approaches
- **ContextAnalyzer**: Evaluates execution context

**Lifecycle** (<100ms total):
```
Spawn (10ms) → Analyze (25-40ms) → Report → Dissolve (10ms)
```

### 3. Neural Network Core (Rust)

**Purpose**: Pattern recognition and prediction

**Architecture**:
- Multi-layer perceptron with backpropagation
- Configurable layers (default: [input, 64, 32, output])
- Learning rate: 0.5 (adjustable)
- Training: Online learning from patterns

**Input Encoding**:
- Tool type → one-hot vector
- Parameters → feature extraction
- Context → temporal features
- History → sequence embedding

### 4. Pattern Storage (SQLite)

**Schema**:

```sql
command_patterns:
  - id: Unique identifier
  - tool: Tool name (e.g., "bq query")
  - params: JSON parameters
  - context: Execution context
  - outcome: success/failure
  - duration: Execution time (ms)
  - error: Error message if failed
  - timestamp: When executed

learned_patterns:
  - pattern_id: Unique pattern ID
  - pattern_type: sequence/failure/success/timing
  - pattern_data: JSON pattern details
  - confidence: 0.0-1.0 confidence score
  - occurrence_count: Times seen
  - last_seen: Most recent occurrence
```

## Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Sequence Learning

Identifies common tool sequences:
```
git pull → git merge → git push
bq show → bq query → bq extract
```

Learns optimal ordering and timing between commands.

### 2. Failure Pattern Recognition

Tracks repeated failures:
- Same command + parameters → consistent failure
- Specific error messages → root cause analysis
- Context correlation → environmental factors

### 3. Success Pattern Mining

Identifies what works:
- Successful parameter combinations
- Optimal execution contexts
- Effective workarounds

### 4. Timing Patterns

Learns execution characteristics:
- Average duration per tool
- Timeout probabilities
- Resource-intensive operations

## Prediction Algorithm

### 1. Input Processing

```typescript
{
  tool: "bq query",
  params: { query: "SELECT * FROM table" },
  context: { 
    recentTools: [...], 
    projectType: "analytics" 
  }
}
```

### 2. Parallel Analysis

Spawn 4 ephemeral agents simultaneously:
```
         Input
      ╱   |   ╲   ╲
Agent1  Agent2  Agent3  Agent4
   ╲      |      ╱    ╱
      Synthesis
```

### 3. Neural Consolidation

```
Historical Patterns (60% weight)
       +
Agent Predictions (30% weight)
       +
Context Modifiers (10% weight)
       ↓
Final Prediction
```

### 4. Response Generation

```json
{
  "successProbability": 0.73,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "warnings": [{
    "level": "medium",
    "message": "Query may timeout on large tables",
    "suggestion": { 
      "tool": "bq query",
      "params": { "query": "... LIMIT 1000" }
    }
  }],
  "explanation": "Based on 47 similar executions",
  "predictedDuration": 3500
}
```

## Domain-Specific Intelligence

### GCP/BigQuery Patterns

**Learned Behaviors**:
- Auth token expiration cycles
- Project/dataset dependencies
- Query cost patterns
- Quota rhythms

**Predictions**:
- "This query will scan 5TB and cost ~$25"
- "Auth token expires in 15 minutes"
- "Dataset creation takes 5-10 seconds"

### Git Operations

**Learned Behaviors**:
- Merge conflict patterns
- CI/CD trigger mappings
- Branch protection rules
- Team workflow patterns

**Predictions**:
- "Push will fail - remote has 3 commits ahead"
- "This commit triggers 5 CI workflows"
- "PR typically reviewed within 2 hours"

## Extension Points

### 1. Custom Agents

Add new agent types:
```rust
pub enum AgentType {
    // Existing...
    SecurityAnalyzer,  // Check for security issues
    CostEstimator,    // Predict resource costs
    PerformanceProfiler, // Analyze performance impact
}
```

### 2. Domain Modules

Create specialized predictors:
```typescript
class AWSPredictor extends DomainPredictor {
  predictEC2Launch(params): Prediction
  predictS3Operations(params): Prediction
  predictLambdaExecution(params): Prediction
}
```

### 3. Learning Strategies

Implement new pattern types:
- Cyclic patterns (daily/weekly rhythms)
- Cascading failures (A fails → B fails)
- Recovery patterns (fail → fix → succeed)

### 4. Neural Architectures

Experiment with:
- LSTM for sequence prediction
- Attention mechanisms for context
- Ensemble models for robustness
